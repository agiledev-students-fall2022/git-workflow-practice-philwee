[Python 3.14 Will be Faster than C++](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-3-14-will-be-faster-than-c-a97edd01d65d)

## A paragraph or two about what you find interesting about that article

One of the major disadvantages of Python for many developers was its speed. While Python may be rather intuitive to program in, given its relatively straightforward syntax, many people would despise using it because it would be signficantly slower than other languages. This article suggests a trend that may potentially lead to Python being faster than C++ (C++ is generally considered a fast language in comparison to Python).

#### Comment from Safal
That's interesting. I never would have thought Python would someday be faster than C++. We already use Python in so many areas even though it's a bit slower. Now, with the speed, I can't imagine all the ways Python is going to be applied everywhere.
