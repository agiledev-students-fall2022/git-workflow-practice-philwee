[Python 3.14 Will be Faster than C++](https://towardsdatascience.com/python-3-14-will-be-faster-than-c-a97edd01d65d)

## A paragraph or two about what you find interesting about that article

One of the major disadvantages of Python for many developers was its speed. While Python may be rather intuitive to program in, given its relatively straightforward syntax, many people would despise using it because it would be signficantly slower than other languages. This article suggests a trend that may potentially lead to Python being faster than C++ (C++ is generally considered a fast language in comparison to Python).

This article is interesting! Back in the CSO class we spent a lot of time learning C/C++ because C/C++ is more efficient than Python. Maybe in the upcoming years we would not need to suffer from C/C++.

#### Comment from Safal
That's interesting. I never would have thought Python would someday be faster than C++. We already use Python in so many areas even though it's a bit slower. Now, with the speed, I can't imagine all the ways Python is going to be applied everywhere.

## Comment from Nghia Nim
I thought this was a troll article at first, given that we know how interpreted languages are much slower in comparison to compiled languages. After reading it, my first thought was "I knew it" :). Though a very entertaining article to read, I do find it incredible that the last two iterations of python improved so drastically in its runtime!
